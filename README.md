# System for building the optimal route on the map

Designed to obtain the optimal route on the map. The system provides REST API and Websocket for easy interaction with clients. Based on the algorithms of "Discrete Mathematics and Graph Theory", the system compares existing routes and creates a more optimal one based on them.

The system can be used by many independent clients, who can create their own users in the system and interact with them.

The system provides various algorithms for determining the path, from standard from Google or other API to combined (using graph theory for optimization).

The system has the ability to send web hooks to the client server for interaction in real-time mode
The system can also be used directly on the client side.
